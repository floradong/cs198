Flood It (snap)

Welcome to Flood-It! We coded the existing game “Flood-It” (https://unixpapa.com/floodit/) on Snap! 

Objective: The objective of the game is to fill a board completely with one color in the given amount of moves. Only the squares of the same color adjacent to the top left corner (as we note, coordinate (1,1) ) will change colors into the desired color the player wants. 

How: To change the squares’ colors, the player must hover their mouse over a square that is the desired color they would want to change the board to. After doing so, the player must press the “a” key to change the color of the squares. Whenever the “a” key is pressed with the mouse hovering over the square, all the squares of the same color adjacent to the top left square (1,1) will turn into the desired color. 

To start the game, the player must click once in the stage and then press the “spacebar” in which a question will appear, asking about the board size. Players may choose their difficulty based on the size of the board they want to play with. From a scale of 2 to 14, players may input their desired board size to get their desired difficulty. For example, if a player wants a slightly hard board and inputs 10, a 10x10 board will appear. 

If the player successfully changes all the squares in the entire board to the same color within the given amount of steps, the screen will display that the player have won. However, if the player ran out of moves and have already used up all their moves before the entire board is changed to the same color, the screen will display that the player has lost and that the game is over.
